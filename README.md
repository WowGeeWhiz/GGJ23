# GGJ23
 
This is our submission for Global Game Jam 2023

Our team members are (in no particular order):

Ethan Johnson, Noah Stephens, Tanner Peters, Sam Peters, Donovan Lott

The theme for the Jam was "Roots" and so our game is a tower-defense game where you must protect your cabin from the encroaching forest as it seeks to reclaim your home. If you should fall, your children shall return in the future to bear the torch.
